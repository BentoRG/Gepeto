    <h1>Resumo GEOGRAPHY - A2P2</h1>

    <h2>AGRICULTURE</h2>

    <p>After the WWII governments in Western European countries introduced subsidies programs (financial support) to encourage farmers in mechanization programs (buying fertilizers too).</p>

    <p>Another measure was to implement protectionism, protecting local farmers from external competition, reducing imports, which helped ensure food security.</p>

    <p>Although these actions increased agricultural productivity, they also brought environmental problems such as soil degradation and water bodies pollution.</p>

    <p>Especially the World Trade Organization was against protectionism and promoted global commerce through the reduction of trade barriers.</p>

    <p>The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) ensures food security monitoring local and imported food products.</p>

    <h2>INDUSTRY</h2>

    <p>Europe was the birthplace of the Industrial Revolutions.</p>

    <p>Currently, however, it has faced industrialization, with less activity and more unemployment in the manufacturing sector, partially caused by the competition from recently industrialized countries.</p>

    <p>To reverse this scenario, countries are trying to convert industrial activities with other countries sectors, emphasizing technological advances and creating new EU policies.</p>

    <h3>IMPORTANT COUNTRIES ECONOMICALLY</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Germany:</b> largest on the continent; focused on exports.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>machinery, chemical, electronic equipments, metallurgy and steel</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>UK:</b> financial sector and banking services very important; both the 2008 crisis and Brexit affected the country in a economic slowdown.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>machinery, chemical products, automation equipment, shipbuilding, aircraft</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>France:</b> problems with balancing public spending and high youth unemployment rates.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>tourism, machinery, chemical products, automobiles, aircraft, electronic equipment</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Italy:</b> internal inequalities, with the north being wealthier and more developed than the south; high public debt, slow economic development and high unemployment rates.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>machinery, chemical products, vehicles, clothing</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>POPULATION</h2>

    <p>Europe has been dealing with population aging in more recent years, due to low birth rates and death rates, as well as high life expectancy (advancing healthcare and quality of life).</p>

    <p>The natural growth (birth rate - death rate) is very slow, due to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>women's active role in workforce</li>
        <li>delay marriage and motherhood</li>
        <li>family planning</li>
        <li>high costs</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Consequences of this population aging:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pressure on the pension system</li>
        <li>Fewer people on the workforce</li>
        <li>Smaller consumer market</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>IMMIGRANTS</h3>

    <p>Due to this decline in economically active population (EAP) the needs for migratory flows and foreign labor increased.</p>

    <p>The numbers of immigrants coming from less developed countries such as those in Asia, Africa, Latin America and former socialists towards more industrialized European countries has gone up.</p>

    <p>Reasons for migration:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Economic</li>
        <li>Political</li>
        <li>Environmental</li>
        <li>Family or education</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Positive impacts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cultural diversity</li>
        <li>Population balance</li>
        <li>Essential jobs</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Challenges faced:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Discrimination</li>
        <li>Lack of governmental support</li>
        <li>Refugee camps (poor living conditions)</li>
    </ul>
