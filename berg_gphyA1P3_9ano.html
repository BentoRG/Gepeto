    <h1>Resumo GEOGRAPHY - A1P3</h1>

    <h2>REGIONS</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Northern Asia: Russia (Siberian)</li>
    <li>Central Asia: Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan</li>
    <li>South Asia: India and Nepal</li>
    <li>Southeastern Asia: Indonesia and Vietnam</li>
    <li>Far East: China and Japan</li>
    <li>Middle East: Iraq and Israel</li>
</ul>

<h2>RELIEF & HYDROGRAPHY</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Hug and tall mountain ranges were originated from tectonic plates movements, such as the Indo-Australian and Eurasian plates, which formed the Himalayan mountain range.</li>
    <li>The long rivers many times are fed by melting ice accumulated in the top of these tall mountains.</li>
    <li>The rivers carry sediments that enriches the soil, supporting agricultural development.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Main rivers: Indu, Ganges, Euphrates and Tigris</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Main use: irrigate crops, generate electricity and water supply to the population.</li>
</ul>

<h2>POPULATION</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Its unevenly distributed population may be explained by:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Climate and relief</li>
        <li>Resource availability</li>
        <li>Economic development</li>
        <li>Social, political and historical reasons</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Its population is also increasing exponentially, with birth rates maintaining high, while death rates have decreased with medical and hygiene improvements.</li>
    <li>Some of the most populated countries (China and India) have implemented population control methods to reduce birth rates, such as the one-child policy in China.</li>
</ul>

<h2>CLIMATE & VEGETATION</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Cold:</b> near the Arctic Circle and high latitudes, with harsh winters and milder summers (vegetation = boreal forest or taiga with pine trees).</li>
    <li><b>Cold Mountain:</b> large mountain ranges in the central part of the continent, with harsh winters and a lot of snowing (vegetation = alpine meadows and boreal forest in lower altitude).</li>
    <li><b>Temperate:</b> in mid-latitudes with 4 well defined seasons and precipitation regularly throughout the year and snow in winter (vegetation = temperate or deciduous forest, with trees losing their leaves in autumn and winter).</li>
    <li><b>Tropical:</b> high average temperatures and dry winters (vegetation = tropical rainforest in humidity and savannas in dry places)</li>
    <li><b>Subtropical:</b> hot and rainy summers and long and cool winters (vegetation = subtropical forests)</li>
    <li><b>Mediterranean:</b> hot summers and cold, rainy winters with medium temperatures (vegetation = mediterranean vegetation, with shrublands)</li>
    <li><b>Desert:</b> large mountains block the moist air masses from coming to deserts, which makes them very dry, with hot days and cold nights (vegetation = species adapted to water scarcity, such as cacti)</li>
    <li><b>Equatorial:</b> near the Equator line, with high average temperatures and high rainfall levels (vegetation = equatorial forest, rich in biodiversity)</li>
    <li><b>Semi-arid:</b> low annual rainfall and high temperatures (vegetation = steppe, with herbaceous plants)</li>

</ul>

<h2>CHINA</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Its unbalanced population is concentrated in Eastern China, and there are fewer populations in the west, due to mountains and deserts.</li>
    <li>In 1949 there were investments in heavy industries with Socialism.</li>
    <li>In 1970's there was the economic plan of the "4 modernizations", investing in agriculture, technology, defense and industry sectors.</li>
    <li>Nowadays, etc Special Economic Zones attract foreign companies and offer low taxes, cheap labor and technologies invested, with its current trade model being "socialist market economy", a mix of socialism policies with an economic market opened to exports.</li>
    <li>Its government has a 1 party system, being authoritarian and having no fully political freedom!</li>
</ul>

<h2>INDIA</h2>
<ul>
    <li>There were successful exports-led industries have negative consequences, such as poor working conditions and environmental problems, resulting in health challenges for the population.</li>
    <li>The population is unevenly distributed, predominant along the Ganges river and major urban centers on the coast and inland.</li>
    <li>The country's population is still majorly (65%) countryside/rural, but the rural exodus has developed the cities into metropolises with lack of infrastructure and legal housing.</li>
    <li>Since it has gained independence it begun to develop economically, beginning with basic industries and advancing later to superstructure and techno-scientific investments.</li>
    <li>India has also attracted foreign companies with tax reductions and cheap labor hired in Export Processing Zones, by the 1970's.</li>
    <li>Its mineral industry also has significant potential, as well as agricultural.</li>
    <li>But it has emerged as an software exports, with production majorly in Bangalore, and investments in researches and educational facilities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>RUSSIA</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Being the main heir of USSR, it had a tuff time adopting to capitalism, privatizing state-owned companies and asking international loans to modernize industries.</li>
    <li>Putin was a strong leader, which helped stabilize the economy, with exports of energy resources, but still quite dependent on these oil and natural gas exports.</li>
    <li>Russia is a great natural power due to fertile regions on its european side, strategic geographic position and abundance in energy resources naturally.</li>
</ul>
