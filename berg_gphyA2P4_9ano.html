    <h2>The Israel-Palestine Conflict</h2>
    <p>Around 2000 B.C., the Jews settled in this area called Palestine, already inhabited by other peoples.</p>
    <p>Later on, great empires took over the place and forced the Jews into Diaspora (forced migration), while their hope was still on returning to this land, which they called Zion.</p>
    <p>After, a few more centuries that land became occupied by Arab Muslims called Palestinians, and under rules of the British.</p>
    <p>There also emerged a movement named Zionism: an international call to the Jews to form an independent state in Palestine.</p>
    <p>With this, by the 1800's, this people started migrating to Zion, which was more populated by Jews by the 1930's, due to Nazi persecutions.</p>
    <p>Once the Jews were one third of Palestine's population, conflicts were heightened, which made the British hand over the situation to an United Nations' Partition Plan.</p>
    <p>This plan gave 55% of the territory to the Jews and 45% to the Arabs.</p>
    <p>Once Jews proclaimed their independent state, there began a series of conflicts with their neighbor Arab countries (Egypt, Lebanon, Iraq, etc); the first war was won by Israel, increasing thus its legal territory, but these continued until nowadays</p>
    <p>As the Palestinians did not have a declared state, many of them were expelled from their homes by the Jews, living as refugees; this exodus is known as NAKBA (catastrophe, in their language).</p>

    <h2>Oceania</h2>
    <p>It's a continent with very low density and high tourism activities.</p>
    <p>Has mostly deserts and forests such as tropical, equatorial, temperate and subtropical.</p>
    <p>It's mostly formed by Australia (considered an island-continent itself), but also has small islands with volcanic activity (many of which belong to other countries) and atolls.</p>
    <p>These islands are divided into 3: Polynesia (east), Melanesia (central) and Micronesia (north).</p>
